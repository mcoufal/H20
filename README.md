# H20
Simple C program solving H20 synchronization problem. School project @FIT BUT(IOS), 2015.

# Run
* make the project (`make`)
* change access rights (`chmod a+x h2o`)
* run with params: `./h20 N GH GO B`
** where (all params have to be integers):
*** N = number of processes representing oxygen
*** GH = maximum amount of time (in miliseconds) determining generation of hydrogen (number of hydrogen processes will be 2 * N)
*** GO = maximum amount of time (in miliseconds) determining generation of oxygen
*** B = maximum amount of time (in miliseconds) determining bonding time of molecules

# Results
Results are stored in h2o.out.
